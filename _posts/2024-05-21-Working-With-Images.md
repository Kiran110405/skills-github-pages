# These are my experiments with Images within the p5js.editor

The reason for why I wanted my second blog post to be experimentations with images within the p5js.editor is because i enjoy editing pictures such as adding filters to them, collages and just making the original photo seem similar but also distinctly different to the new image thatI was able to produce with it. As well as this, I also enjoy the idea of playing with images and manipulating their properties to see what I am able to and not able to change about them.

## First Image eperiment within p5js.editor

[My Working with images example](/skills-github-pages/creativeCode/Image-work-1/index.html)

In this example of my work, you can see how i have altered an image in a way where the image is still the exact same, but there is a property of the image that was not there before, the flashing colours. Showing my experiments with graphical techniques in p5js.editor. My starting point and inspiration for this piece of work is work that we had done in class where we workied with filters, and changed how the image looked. Where as i wanted to go a step further within this example and give the image multiple flashing colours.

In this screenshot that I have taken directly from my code, this is a representation of how I have been able to, first of all, implement the image that I wanted to use so that I could edit and add filters upon it. The "loadImage" tag is how I am able to grab my image that I have saved from the file and able to bring it all the way to the p5js.editor and edit.

This is another screenshot that I have taken from my code for this work of mine and what this code is showing you is how i have actually managed to give the photo of the car a unique property/ filter. The "tint" element is the tag that allows me to start adding the filters that I wanted to add to the image. Whether I wanted to add a blue, green or yellow filter. However, once I first added the filter, I thought about how I could make the filter of the photo more creative.

The idea that I came up with was "what if I had the filter change into multiple colours?". The reason for why I came up with this idea is because I remembered that is the early stages of our creative coding lessons, one thing we were taught was how we could give an object multiple colours, aswell as this, I had also used the same technqiue in my 3D modelling examples witht ehc ube and how I made that change into multiple colours.

This screen shot is that same i had shown before but more focusing on the part of the code that actually allows the filter colours to change from one to another. How this is done is that the "frameCount" element that is there connects the filter/colours to the framecount within the p5js.editor. The 10 controls how quickly I want the filter to switch between the colours so that it doesnt change too fast or too slow.
