# These are my experiments with Images within the p5js.editor

The reason for why I wanted my second blog post to be experimentations with images within the p5js.editor is because i enjoy editing pictures such as adding fikters to them, collages and just making the original photo seem similar but also distinctly different to the new image thatI was able to produce with it. As well as this, I also enjoy the idea of playing with images and manipulating their properties to see what I am able to and not able to change about them.

## First Image eperiment within p5js.editor

[My Working with images example](/skills-github-pages/creativeCode/Image-work_1/index.html)

In this example of my work, you can see how i have altered an image in a way where the image is still the exact same, but there is a property of the image that was not there before, the flashing colours. Showing my experiments with graphical techniques in p5js.editor. My starting point and inspiration for this piece of work is work that we had done in class where we workied with filters, and changed how the image looked. Where as i wanted to go a step further within this example and give the image multiple colours.
