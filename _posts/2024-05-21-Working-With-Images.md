# These are my experiments with Images within the p5js.editor

The reason for why I wanted my second blog post to be experimentations with images within the p5js.editor is because i enjoy editing pictures such as adding fikters to them, collages and just making the original photo seem similar but also distinctly different to the new image thatI was able to produce with it. As well as this, I also enjoy the idea of playing with images and manipulating their properties to see what I am able to and not able to change about them.
