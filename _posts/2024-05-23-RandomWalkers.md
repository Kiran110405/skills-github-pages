# My Experiments with Random Walkers

The reasom for why I have chosen random walkers for my third blog post of different experimentaions within the p5js.editor is because I love how unpredicatble they are, I love the idea of coding events that happen randomly but somehpw create some sort of art that you are both in control off and not in control off. You get to see what the actualy computer makes itself with the instructions that you have given it
