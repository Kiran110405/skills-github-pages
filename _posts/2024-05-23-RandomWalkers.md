# My Experiments with Random Walkers

The reasom for why I have chosen random walkers for my third blog post of different experimentaions within the p5js.editor is because I love how unpredicatble they are, I love the idea of coding events that happen randomly but somehpw create some sort of art that you are both in control off and not in control off. You get to see what the actualy computer makes itself with the instructions that you have given it.

In the link above you are able to view my first experiment that I have done in the p5js.editor in regards to creating "Random Walkers". In the experiment I have started with something simple but which also has a unique property. I created a singulare line that moves in any random direction in which it pleases and while it does this, it was chooses random colours that the line wants to become while the line moves itself around the canvas.
