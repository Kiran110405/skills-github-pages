# 3D Modelling
## These are my variations and experiments of using 3D modeling on p5.js editor


## First 3D Modelling Experiment

[My first 3D example code](/skills-github-pages/creativeCode/3D modelling_4/index.html)

Within the link, you are able to see my first product of me using methods for 3D modelling using javascript in P5js.editor. As you can see the only thing that I did with this example is that I produced a sphere shape to create the 3D effect as if I was to use a 2D circle for the animation it wouldnt seem that outstanding. To empahsise the 3D propertie, I left lines on the shape so you could really see the curves and dimensions of the sphere whereas rather than removing then lines to make the shape seem more smooth.

This screenshot that you can see from above here shows to key features that play a big role in the code. The first line of code that is visible shows how i have been able to convey the rotation of the 3D object, and the "Y" where after it says "rotation" is implemented so that the sphere turns on its y-axis. So this is why in the 3D model that I have first linked on the page is spinning around demonstraing its 3D property in full effect.

Now, the second line of code that is visble in this screenshot shows how i have actually been able to create the 3D shape, the sphere, itself. So to explain, the reason for why I have written "sphere" is because that is how you create your object within p5js.editor. Aswell as this, the number within the brackets determins the size of the object itelf (so the bigger the number the bigger the object). The inspiration for this example is derived from the work that we had done in class as I enjoyed the simplicity of the model and found it almost staisfying to watch. As well as another reason being that i thought that the code itself was simple enough for me to start with the have a good understanding of how to start. 

## Second 3D Modelling Experiment

In this link that i have put you are able to see my second attempt at 3D modelling using the p5js.editor where my goal here, isnt to make some outstanding piece if work, but just to aim to further develop my work and make it unique and different from the original. So in the example of my 3D model you can see that what i have made is a cube, a cube that spins in all directions as well as having a unique property which is different from my first model as this cube changes colour instead of staying as one.
