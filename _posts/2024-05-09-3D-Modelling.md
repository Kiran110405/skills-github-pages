# 3D Modelling
## These are my variations and experiments of using 3D modeling on p5.js editor


## First 3D Modelling Experiment

[My first 3D example code](/skills-github-pages/creativeCode/3D modelling_4/index.html)

Within the link, you are able to see my first product of me using methods for 3D modelling using javascript in P5js.editor. As you can see the only thing that I did with this example is that I produced a sphere shape to create the 3D effect as if I was to use a 2D circle for the animation it wouldnt seem that outstanding. To empahsise the 3D propertie, I left lines on the shape so you could really see the curves and dimensions of the sphere whereas rather than removing then lines to make the shape seem more smooth.
